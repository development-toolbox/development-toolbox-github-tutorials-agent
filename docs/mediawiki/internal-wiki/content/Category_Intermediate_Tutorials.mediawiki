* [[Code Review Guidelines]] - Give and receive effective feedback
* [[Managing Issues and Projects]] - Organise work and track progress

=== Automation and CI/CD ===
* [[GitHub Actions Workflows]] - Automate your development process
* [[Branch Protection Rules]] - Secure your important branches
* [[GitHub API Integration]] - Automate GitHub operations
* [[CI/CD Tools]] - Integrate with external tools and services

=== Repository Management ===
* [[Advanced Repository Settings]] - Configure repositories for teams
* [[Security Configuration]] - Implement security best practices
* [[Performance Optimization]] - Handle large repositories efficiently
* [[Backup and Migration Strategies]] - Protect and move your data

== Learning Path ==

We recommend following this sequence for intermediate topics:

=== Phase 1: Team Collaboration (2-3 weeks) ===
# [[Pull Request Best Practices]] - Foundation of team development
