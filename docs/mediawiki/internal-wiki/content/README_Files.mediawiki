= README Files =

README files are the front door to your project. They're the first thing people see and often determine whether someone will use, contribute to, or even trust your project.

== What is a README? ==

A README file is a text document that introduces and explains your project:
* '''First impression''' - What visitors see on your repository homepage
* '''Project overview''' - What your project does and why it matters
* '''Getting started guide''' - How to install, configure, and use your project
* '''Documentation hub''' - Links to more detailed documentation
* '''Invitation to contribute''' - How others can help improve your project

{{Note|The name "README" comes from the convention of creating a file that says "read me first" to provide essential information.}}

=== Why README Files Matter ===

A good README file:
* '''Saves time''' - Answers common questions before they're asked
* '''Increases adoption''' - Makes it easy for others to try your project
* '''Improves collaboration''' - Clear guidelines for contributors
* '''Builds trust''' - Professional presentation inspires confidence
* '''Enhances discoverability''' - Search engines and GitHub index README content

=== README File Formats ===

'''Common formats:'''
* '''README.md''' - Markdown format (most popular)
* '''README.txt''' - Plain text
* '''README.rst''' - reStructuredText
* '''README''' - Plain text without extension

{{Good|Use README.md for the best GitHub experience. Markdown provides rich formatting while remaining readable as plain text.}}

== Essential README Sections ==

=== Project Title and Description ===

Start with a clear, compelling introduction:

{{Code|markdown|
# Project Name

Brief, one-sentence description of what your project does.

Longer paragraph explaining the problem your project solves, 
who it's for, and what makes it special.
}}

'''Best practices:'''
* Use a descriptive project name
* Lead with benefits, not technical details
* Keep the first sentence under 25 words
* Avoid jargon and acronyms

git add README.md src/new-feature.js
git commit -m "Add new feature and update documentation"
```
}}

'''Review checklist:'''
- [ ] Is the description still accurate?
- [ ] Do installation instructions work?
- [ ] Are examples up to date?
- [ ] Do all links work?
- [ ] Are screenshots current?
