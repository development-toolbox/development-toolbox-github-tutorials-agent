= Introduction to Version Control =

Version control is the foundation of modern software development. Understanding these concepts will transform how you work with code, documents, and collaborative projects.

== What is Version Control? ==

Version control is a system that tracks changes to files over time, allowing you to:
* '''Recall specific versions''' of files from the past
* '''See what changed''' between versions
* '''Collaborate''' with others without conflicts
* '''Backup your work''' automatically
* '''Experiment safely''' with new features

{{Note|Think of version control as a "save game" system for your projects - you can always go back to any previous state.}}

=== Real-World Analogies ===

'''Google Docs Version History:'''
* See all changes made to a document
* Restore previous versions
* See who made what changes
* Collaborate simultaneously

'''Video Game Save Files:'''
* Save your progress at different points
* Load a previous save if something goes wrong
* Multiple save slots for different paths
* Share saves with friends

'''Photo Albums:'''
* Chronological organisation of memories
* Tag photos with descriptions
* Share albums with family
* Never lose precious moments

== Why Use Version Control? ==

=== Without Version Control ===

Common problems when working without version control:
* '''Lost work''' - Accidentally delete or overwrite files
* '''Merge conflicts''' - Multiple people editing the same file
* '''No history''' - Can't see what changed or when
* '''No backup''' - Single point of failure
* '''Collaboration chaos''' - Emailing files back and forth

'''Typical file naming without version control:'''
{{Code|text|
project.doc
project_final.doc
project_final_v2.doc
project_final_v2_really_final.doc
project_final_v2_really_final_THIS_ONE.doc
}}

{{Warning|This chaotic approach leads to confusion, lost work, and frustrated team members.}}

=== With Version Control ===

Benefits of using version control systems:
* '''Complete history''' - Every change is tracked and recoverable
* '''Branching''' - Work on features without affecting main project
* '''Merging''' - Combine work from multiple contributors
* '''Blame/annotation''' - See who changed what and when
* '''Distributed backup''' - Your code exists in multiple places
* '''Collaboration''' - Multiple people can work simultaneously

== Core Concepts ==

=== Repository (Repo) ===

A '''repository''' is a project folder tracked by version control:
* Contains all your project files
* Stores complete history of changes
* Can be local (on your computer) or remote (on GitHub)
* Acts as the central hub for collaboration

=== Commits ===

A '''commit''' is a snapshot of your project at a specific moment:
* Records what files changed
* Includes a descriptive message
* Has a unique identifier (hash)
* Forms a chain of project history

'''Commit anatomy:'''
* '''Changes''' - Which files were modified, added, or deleted
* '''Message''' - Human-readable description of what changed
* '''Author''' - Who made the changes
* '''Timestamp''' - When the changes were made
* '''Parent''' - Link to the previous commit

{{Good|Think of commits as diary entries for your project - each one tells a story about what happened.}}

=== Working Directory ===

Your '''working directory''' is the current state of files:
* What you see in your file system
* May contain uncommitted changes
* Where you edit and modify files
* The "live" version of your project

=== Staging Area ===

The '''staging area''' is a preparation space for commits:
* Choose which changes to include in next commit
* Review changes before committing
* Allows for atomic, focused commits
* Sometimes called the "index"

'''Three states of files:'''
1. '''Modified''' - Changed but not staged
2. '''Staged''' - Marked for inclusion in next commit  
3. '''Committed''' - Safely stored in repository history

== Understanding Git ==

=== What is Git? ===

Git is the most popular version control system:
* '''Distributed''' - Every copy is a complete backup
* '''Fast''' - Optimised for performance
* '''Flexible''' - Supports many different workflows
* '''Open source''' - Free and continuously improved
* '''Industry standard''' - Used by millions of developers

=== Git vs GitHub ===

Important distinction:
* '''Git''' - The version control system (software)
* '''GitHub''' - A hosting service for Git repositories (website)

'''Analogy:'''
* Git is like Microsoft Word (the software)
* GitHub is like Google Drive (the cloud storage service)

=== Distributed Version Control ===

Unlike centralised systems, Git is distributed:
* '''Every copy is complete''' - Full history in every repository
* '''No single point of failure''' - If one copy is lost, others remain
* '''Work offline''' - No internet connection required for most operations
* '''Multiple remotes''' - Can sync with several other repositories

'''Centralised vs Distributed:'''

'''Centralised (old way):'''
{{Code|text|
Developer A ←→ Central Server ←→ Developer B
}}

'''Distributed (Git way):'''
{{Code|text|
Developer A ←→ GitHub ←→ Developer B
     ↓                    ↓
Local Repository    Local Repository
}}

## Basic Workflow ==

=== The Git Lifecycle ===

Understanding the basic Git workflow:

1. '''Modify files''' - Edit code in your working directory
2. '''Stage changes''' - Select which changes to commit
3. '''Commit changes''' - Save snapshot to repository
4. '''Push changes''' - Share with remote repository (GitHub)

'''Visual representation:'''
{{Code|text|
Working Directory → Staging Area → Local Repository → Remote Repository
     (edit)           (add)          (commit)         (push)
}}

=== Example Workflow ===

Here's what a typical development session looks like:

{{Code|bash|
# 1. Check current status
git status

# 2. Edit some files
# (make changes in your editor)

# 3. See what changed
git diff

# 4. Stage changes for commit
git add file1.txt file2.txt

# 5. Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Add user authentication feature"

# 6. Push to GitHub
git push origin main
}}

=== Branching and Merging ===

'''Branches''' allow parallel development:
* '''Main branch''' - Stable, production-ready code
* '''Feature branches''' - New features in development
* '''Bug fix branches''' - Fixes for specific issues
* '''Experiment branches''' - Try new ideas safely

'''Merging''' combines work from different branches:
* Integrate completed features into main branch
* Preserve history of all changes
* Handle conflicts when same code is modified
* Maintain project stability

{{Info|Branching is like having multiple parallel universes for your project - you can experiment in one without affecting the others.}}

== Collaboration with Version Control ==

=== How Teams Use Version Control ===

Version control enables effective teamwork:
* '''Parallel development''' - Multiple people work simultaneously
* '''Change tracking''' - See exactly what each person contributed
* '''Code review''' - Examine changes before integration
* '''Release management''' - Tag stable versions for deployment

=== Common Collaboration Patterns ===

'''Feature Branch Workflow:'''
1. Create branch for new feature
2. Develop feature in isolation
3. Create pull request for review
4. Merge after approval
5. Delete feature branch

'''Fork and Pull Model:'''
1. Fork repository to your account
2. Clone fork to local machine
3. Make changes and commit
4. Push changes to your fork
5. Create pull request to original repository

=== Handling Conflicts ===

When multiple people edit the same code:
* '''Git detects conflicts''' automatically
* '''Manual resolution''' required for overlapping changes
* '''Merge tools''' help visualise and resolve conflicts
* '''Communication''' prevents most conflicts

{{Good|Regular communication and small, frequent commits reduce the likelihood of conflicts.}}

== Version Control Best Practices ==

=== Commit Messages ===

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:
* '''Use present tense''' - "Add feature" not "Added feature"
* '''Be specific''' - Explain what and why, not just what
* '''Keep first line short''' - 50 characters or less
* '''Add details if needed''' - Use multiple lines for complex changes

'''Good commit messages:'''
{{Code|text|
Add user authentication with OAuth2
Fix memory leak in image processing
Update README with installation instructions
Refactor database connection handling
}}

'''Poor commit messages:'''
{{Code|text|
Fixed stuff
Updates
Changed files
Work in progress
}}

=== When to Commit ===

Commit frequently with focused changes:
* '''Atomic commits''' - One logical change per commit
* '''Working code''' - Don't commit broken functionality
* '''Complete features''' - Finish what you start
* '''Regular rhythm''' - Commit at least daily

=== Repository Organisation ===

Keep repositories organised:
* '''One project per repository''' - Don't mix unrelated projects  
* '''Clear structure''' - Organise files logically
* '''Documentation''' - Include README and other docs
* '''Ignore unnecessary files''' - Use .gitignore appropriately

== Types of Version Control Systems ==

=== Centralised Systems ===

Traditional approach with single central server:
* '''Examples''' - Subversion (SVN), Perforce, Team Foundation Server
* '''Pros''' - Simple model, easy to understand
* '''Cons''' - Single point of failure, requires network access

=== Distributed Systems ===

Modern approach with multiple complete copies:
* '''Examples''' - Git, Mercurial, Bazaar
* '''Pros''' - No single point of failure, work offline, faster
* '''Cons''' - More complex initially, larger storage requirements

=== Why Git Won ===

Git became dominant because:
* '''Speed''' - Extremely fast operations
* '''Flexibility''' - Supports many workflows
* '''Reliability''' - Strong data integrity
* '''Community''' - Large ecosystem and tooling
* '''GitHub''' - Excellent hosting and collaboration platform

== Beyond Code: Other Uses ==

Version control isn't just for programmers:

=== Documentation ===

* '''Technical writing''' - Track changes to manuals and guides
* '''Collaboration''' - Multiple writers working together
* '''Publishing''' - Maintain different versions for different audiences
* '''Translation''' - Coordinate translation efforts

=== Creative Projects ===

* '''Writing''' - Track novel or screenplay development
* '''Design''' - Version control for design files
* '''Research''' - Manage research data and analysis
* '''Legal documents''' - Track contract and policy changes

=== Configuration Management ===

* '''System configuration''' - Server setup and deployment scripts
* '''Infrastructure as code''' - Cloud resource definitions
* '''Environment management''' - Development, staging, production configs
* '''Backup and recovery''' - Maintain historical snapshots

{{Success|Version control transforms chaotic file management into organised, collaborative, and reliable workflows.}}

== Common Misconceptions ==

=== "It's Too Complicated" ===

'''Reality:''' While Git has many features, you only need to learn a few basic commands to get started. Most developers use the same 5-10 commands daily.

=== "It's Only for Programmers" ===

'''Reality:''' Version control benefits anyone working with files that change over time - writers, designers, researchers, and more.

=== "I Don't Need It for Small Projects" ===

'''Reality:''' Version control is most valuable for small projects where you can't afford to lose work. The overhead is minimal compared to the benefits.

=== "I Can Just Use Dropbox/Google Drive" ===

'''Reality:''' While cloud storage provides backup, it doesn't provide the change tracking, branching, merging, and collaboration features of proper version control.
