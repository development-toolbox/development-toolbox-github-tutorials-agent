= Creating Your GitHub Account =

Your GitHub account is your identity in the world's largest code hosting platform. This guide walks you through creating and configuring your account for success.

== Before You Begin ==

=== What You'll Need ===

* Valid email address (preferably your work email)
* Strong password
* Mobile device for two-factor authentication (recommended)
* Username ideas (GitHub usernames are unique globally)

{{Note|If your organisation provides GitHub Enterprise, check with your IT department before creating a personal account.}}

== Account Creation Process ==

=== Step 1: Visit GitHub ===

1. Go to [https://github.com github.com]
2. Click '''Sign up''' in the top-right corner
3. You'll see the account creation form

=== Step 2: Choose Your Username ===

Your username will be part of your GitHub URL: `github.com/yourusername`

'''Best practices for usernames:'''
* Use your real name or professional alias
* Keep it professional and memorable
* Avoid special characters and numbers if possible
* Consider using the same username across platforms

'''Examples:'''
* ✅ `john-smith`, `johnsmith`, `j-smith`
* ❌ `coolcoder123`, `xXx_dev_xXx`, `temp-user`

{{Good|Choose a username you'll be comfortable using professionally for years to come.}}

=== Step 3: Email and Password ===

'''Email address:'''
* Use your primary email (work email for professional use)
* You can add additional emails later
* This email will receive GitHub notifications

'''Password requirements:'''
* At least 8 characters long
* Include mix of letters, numbers, and symbols
* Avoid common passwords
* Use a password manager for best security

=== Step 4: Verify You're Human ===

Complete the verification challenge (usually a puzzle or CAPTCHA).

=== Step 5: Email Verification ===

1. Check your email for verification message
2. Click the verification link
3. Return to GitHub to continue setup

== Initial Account Setup ==

=== Choose Your Plan ===

'''Free Plan includes:'''
* Unlimited public repositories
* Unlimited private repositories
* GitHub Actions (2,000 minutes/month)
* GitHub Packages (500MB storage)
* Community support

'''Pro Plan adds:'''
* Advanced tools and insights
* Protected branches on private repos
* Multiple reviewers for pull requests
* More GitHub Actions minutes

{{Info|Most users start with the free plan and upgrade later as needed.}}

=== Profile Information ===

Complete your profile to make a good first impression:

'''Profile Picture:'''
* Upload a professional photo or use an avatar
* Square images work best (400x400 pixels recommended)
* Avoid logos unless you represent that organisation

'''Bio:'''
* Brief description of your role or interests
* Keep it professional and concise
* Examples: "Software Developer at XYZ Corp", "Full-stack developer passionate about open source"

'''Location and Company:'''

=== Contact Information ===

Add ways for people to reach you:

{{Warning|Only share contact information you're comfortable making public.}}

== Security Configuration ==

=== Enable Two-Factor Authentication ===

Two-factor authentication (2FA) is crucial for account security:

1. Go to Settings → Password and authentication
2. Click '''Enable two-factor authentication'''
3. Choose your method:
   * '''Authenticator app''' (recommended): Google Authenticator, Authy, 1Password
   * '''SMS''': Less secure but better than nothing

'''Setting up authenticator app:'''
1. Install authenticator app on your phone
2. Scan QR code with the app
3. Enter the 6-digit code to verify
4. Save recovery codes in a secure location

{{Critical|Store your 2FA recovery codes in a secure location. Without them, you could lose access to your account.}}

=== SSH Keys Setup ===

SSH keys provide secure, password-free authentication:

'''Generating SSH keys:'''
{{Code|bash|
# Generate new SSH key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.email@example.com"

# Start SSH agent
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

# Add SSH key to agent
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# Copy public key to clipboard (macOS)
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

# Copy public key to clipboard (Windows)
clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

# Copy public key to clipboard (Linux)
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | xclip -selection clipboard
}}

'''Adding SSH key to GitHub:'''
1. Go to Settings → SSH and GPG keys
2. Click '''New SSH key'''
3. Give it a descriptive title (e.g., "Work Laptop - MacBook Pro")
4. Paste your public key
5. Click '''Add SSH key'''

'''Testing SSH connection:'''
{{Code|bash|
ssh -T git@github.com
}}

You should see: "Hi username! You've successfully authenticated..."

=== Personal Access Tokens ===

For HTTPS authentication and API access:

1. Go to Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
2. Click '''Generate new token'''
3. Give it a descriptive name
4. Select appropriate scopes:
   * `repo` - Full repository access
   * `user` - User profile access
   * `notifications` - Notification access
5. Set expiration date (recommended: 90 days)
6. Copy token and store securely

{{Warning|Treat personal access tokens like passwords. Never commit them to repositories or share them.}}

== Privacy and Notifications ==

=== Privacy Settings ===

Configure what information is public:

'''Profile visibility:'''
* Email address privacy
* Activity visibility
* Contribution graph visibility
* Achievement visibility

'''Repository visibility:'''
* Default repository visibility (public/private)
* Fork visibility settings

=== Notification Preferences ===

Customise how GitHub communicates with you:

'''Email notifications:'''
* Comments on issues and pull requests

* Security alerts

'''Web notifications:'''
