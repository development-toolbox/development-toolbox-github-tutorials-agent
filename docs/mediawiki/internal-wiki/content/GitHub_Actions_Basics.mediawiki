= GitHub Actions Basics =

GitHub Actions is a powerful automation platform that lets you build, test, and deploy your code directly from GitHub repositories using custom workflows.

== What are GitHub Actions? ==

GitHub Actions provides event-driven automation for your software development lifecycle:
* '''Continuous Integration''' - Automatically build and test code changes
* '''Continuous Deployment''' - Deploy applications when code is pushed
* '''Workflow Automation''' - Automate repetitive tasks and processes
* '''Custom Actions''' - Create reusable automation components
* '''Integrated Platform''' - Built directly into GitHub with no external setup

{{Note|GitHub Actions is included with GitHub and provides generous free usage limits for public repositories and GitHub Free accounts.}}

=== Key Benefits ===

'''Seamless Integration:'''
* Built into GitHub - no external CI/CD service needed
* Direct access to repository code and metadata
* Integrated with GitHub features like Issues and Pull Requests
* Native support for GitHub's authentication and permissions

'''Flexibility and Power:'''
* Support for multiple operating systems and environments
* Extensive marketplace of pre-built actions
* Matrix builds for testing across multiple configurations
* Secret management for secure deployment

== Core Concepts ==

=== Workflows ===

Workflows are automated processes defined in YAML files:
* Stored in `.github/workflows/` directory
* Triggered by events (push, pull request, schedule, etc.)
* Contain one or more jobs that run in sequence or parallel
* Can be shared and reused across repositories

=== Events ===

Events trigger workflow execution:
* '''Repository events''' - push, pull_request, release
* '''Scheduled events''' - cron-based triggers
* '''Manual events''' - workflow_dispatch for manual triggering
* '''External events''' - webhooks from external services

=== Jobs ===

Jobs are groups of steps that execute on the same runner:
* Run in parallel by default
* Can depend on other jobs
* Execute on virtual machines (runners)
* Share data through artifacts

=== Steps ===

Steps are individual tasks within a job:
* Run commands or actions
* Execute sequentially within a job
* Can use pre-built actions from marketplace
* Access to workflow context and environment

=== Actions ===

Actions are reusable units of code:
* Pre-built actions from GitHub Marketplace
* Custom actions you create
* Can be written in JavaScript, Docker, or composite
* Packaged and versioned for reuse

=== Runners ===

Runners are virtual machines that execute workflows:
* '''GitHub-hosted runners''' - Managed by GitHub
* '''Self-hosted runners''' - Your own infrastructure
* Support Linux, Windows, and macOS
* Different machine sizes available

== Creating Your First Workflow ==

=== Basic Workflow Structure ===

Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

{{Code|yaml|
name: CI

# Trigger events
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

# Workflow jobs
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: '18'
        cache: 'npm'
        
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
      
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
}}

=== Workflow Breakdown ===

'''Workflow metadata:'''
{{Code|yaml|
name: CI  # Workflow name shown in GitHub UI
}}

'''Event triggers:'''
{{Code|yaml|
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]    # Trigger on push to these branches
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]             # Trigger on PRs to main
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'           # Daily at midnight UTC
  workflow_dispatch:               # Manual trigger
}}

'''Job configuration:'''
{{Code|yaml|
jobs:
  test:                           # Job ID
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest        # Runner type
    timeout-minutes: 10           # Job timeout
    strategy:                     # Matrix strategy
      matrix:
        node-version: [16, 18, 20]
}}

'''Step definitions:'''
{{Code|yaml|
steps:
- name: Step name               # Human-readable step name
  uses: actions/checkout@v4     # Use pre-built action
  with:                         # Action inputs
    fetch-depth: 0
    
- name: Run command
  run: |                        # Multi-line shell command
    echo "Hello World"
    npm install
  env:                          # Environment variables
    NODE_ENV: test
}}

== Common Workflow Patterns ==

=== Node.js CI Workflow ===

Complete Node.js testing and building:

{{Code|yaml|
name: Node.js CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [16, 18, 20]
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        cache: 'npm'
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    
    - name: Run linting
      run: npm run lint
    
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
    
    - name: Run build
      run: npm run build
    
    - name: Upload coverage reports
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
      if: matrix.node-version == '18'
      with:
        token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
}}

=== Python CI Workflow ===

Testing Python applications:

{{Code|yaml|
name: Python CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.8, 3.9, "3.10", "3.11"]
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    
    - name: Lint with flake8
      run: |
        flake8 . --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics
        flake8 . --count --exit-zero --max-complexity=10 --max-line-length=127 --statistics
    
    - name: Test with pytest
      run: |
        pytest --cov=./ --cov-report=xml
    
    - name: Upload coverage to Codecov
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
      with:
        token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
        file: ./coverage.xml
}}

=== Multi-Job Workflow ===

Workflows with dependencies and parallel execution:

{{Code|yaml|
name: Build and Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
  
  build:
    needs: test                    # Wait for test job to complete
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Build application
      run: npm run build
    - name: Upload build artifacts
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: build-files
        path: dist/
  
  deploy-staging:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: staging           # Deployment environment
    steps:
    - name: Download build artifacts
      uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: build-files
        path: dist/
    - name: Deploy to staging
      run: echo "Deploying to staging..."
  
  deploy-production:
    needs: [test, build]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: production
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'  # Only deploy from main
    steps:
    - name: Deploy to production
      run: echo "Deploying to production..."
}}

== Working with Actions ==

=== Popular Actions from Marketplace ===

'''Setup actions:'''
{{Code|yaml|
# Checkout repository code
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    fetch-depth: 0              # Full history
    token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}   # Custom token

# Setup Node.js
- uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: '18'
    cache: 'npm'
    registry-url: 'https://registry.npmjs.org'

# Setup Python
- uses: actions/setup-python@v4
  with:
    python-version: '3.11'
    cache: 'pip'

# Setup Java
- uses: actions/setup-java@v3
  with:
    distribution: 'temurin'
    java-version: '17'
    cache: 'maven'
}}

'''Utility actions:'''
{{Code|yaml|
# Upload artifacts
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: test-results
    path: test-results/
    retention-days: 30

# Download artifacts
- uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: test-results

# Cache dependencies
- uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: ~/.npm
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-node-
}}

'''Deployment actions:'''
{{Code|yaml|
# Deploy to Azure
- uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v2
  with:
    app-name: my-app
    publish-profile: ${{ secrets.AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE }}

# Deploy to AWS
- uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2
  with:
    aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
    aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
    aws-region: us-east-1

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
- uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
  with:
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    publish_dir: ./dist
}}

=== Using Secrets ===

Store sensitive information securely:

'''Repository secrets setup:'''
1. Go to repository Settings
2. Click Secrets and variables → Actions
3. Click "New repository secret"
4. Add name and value
5. Use in workflows with `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}`

'''Using secrets in workflows:'''
{{Code|yaml|
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Deploy with API key
      run: |
        curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.API_TOKEN }}" \
             -d '{"version": "1.0.0"}' \
             https://api.example.com/deploy
      env:
        API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.API_TOKEN }}
        DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.DATABASE_URL }}
}}

'''Environment-specific secrets:'''
{{Code|yaml|
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: production        # Use environment-specific secrets
    steps:
    - name: Deploy to production
      run: deploy.sh
      env:
        DEPLOY_KEY: ${{ secrets.PRODUCTION_DEPLOY_KEY }}
}}

=== Matrix Strategies ===

Test across multiple configurations:

'''Basic matrix:'''
{{Code|yaml|
strategy:
  matrix:
    os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
    node-version: [16, 18, 20]

runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
steps:
- name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
}}

'''Advanced matrix with includes/excludes:'''
{{Code|yaml|
strategy:
  fail-fast: false
  matrix:
    os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
    node-version: [16, 18, 20]
    include:
      - os: ubuntu-latest
        node-version: 20
        experimental: true
    exclude:
      - os: windows-latest
        node-version: 16

runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
continue-on-error: ${{ matrix.experimental == true }}
}}

== Conditional Execution ==

=== Using If Conditions ===

Control when steps and jobs run:

{{Code|yaml|
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'  # Only on main branch
    steps:
    - name: Deploy to production
      if: success()                      # Only if previous steps succeeded
      run: deploy.sh
    
    - name: Notify on failure
      if: failure()                      # Only if any step failed
      run: notify-failure.sh
    
    - name: Always run cleanup
      if: always()                       # Always run regardless of status
      run: cleanup.sh
}}

'''Common conditions:'''
{{Code|yaml|
# Branch conditions
if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/heads/feature/')

# Event conditions
if: github.event_name == 'push'
if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'

# Status conditions
if: success()        # Previous steps succeeded
if: failure()        # Any previous step failed
if: cancelled()      # Workflow was cancelled
if: always()         # Always run

# File change conditions
if: contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '[skip ci]')
if: github.event.pull_request.draft == false

# Environment conditions
if: runner.os == 'Linux'
if: env.ENVIRONMENT == 'production'
}}

=== Path-based Triggers ===

Only run workflows when specific files change:

{{Code|yaml|
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
    paths:
      - 'src/**'
      - 'package.json'
      - '.github/workflows/**'
  pull_request:
    paths-ignore:
      - 'docs/**'
      - '*.md'
      - '.gitignore'

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
}}

== Advanced Features ==

=== Reusable Workflows ===

Create workflows that can be called by other workflows:

'''Reusable workflow (`.github/workflows/reusable-test.yml`):'''
{{Code|yaml|
name: Reusable Test Workflow

on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      node-version:
        required: true
        type: string
      environment:
        required: false
        type: string
        default: 'test'
    secrets:
      API_TOKEN:
        required: true

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: ${{ inputs.environment }}
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: ${{ inputs.node-version }}
    - run: npm test
      env:
        API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.API_TOKEN }}
}}

'''Calling reusable workflow:'''
{{Code|yaml|
name: Main CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/reusable-test.yml
    with:
      node-version: '18'
      environment: 'staging'
    secrets:
      API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.API_TOKEN }}

  test-multiple:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [16, 18, 20]
    uses: ./.github/workflows/reusable-test.yml
    with:
      node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
    secrets: inherit  # Pass all secrets
}}

=== Custom Actions ===

Create your own actions for reusability:

'''JavaScript action (`action.yml`):'''
{{Code|yaml|
name: 'Hello World Action'
description: 'Greet someone and record the time'
inputs:
  who-to-greet:
    description: 'Who to greet'
    required: true
    default: 'World'
outputs:
  time:
    description: 'The time we greeted you'
runs:
  using: 'node16'
  main: 'index.js'
}}

'''JavaScript implementation (`index.js`):'''
{{Code|javascript|
const core = require('@actions/core');
const github = require('@actions/github');

try {
  const nameToGreet = core.getInput('who-to-greet');
  console.log(`Hello ${nameToGreet}!`);
  
  const time = (new Date()).toTimeString();
  core.setOutput("time", time);
  
  const payload = JSON.stringify(github.context.payload, undefined, 2);
  console.log(`The event payload: ${payload}`);
} catch (error) {
  core.setFailed(error.message);
}
}}

'''Using custom action:'''
{{Code|yaml|
steps:
- name: Hello world action step
  id: hello
  uses: ./.github/actions/hello-world-action
  with:
    who-to-greet: 'GitHub Actions'

- name: Get the output time
  run: echo "The time was ${{ steps.hello.outputs.time }}"
}}

=== Composite Actions ===

Combine multiple steps into a single action:

{{Code|yaml|
name: 'Setup Node.js with Cache'
description: 'Setup Node.js and restore/save npm cache'

inputs:
  node-version:
    description: 'Node.js version'
    required: true
  working-directory:
    description: 'Working directory'
    required: false
    default: '.'

runs:
  using: 'composite'
  steps:
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: ${{ inputs.node-version }}
        cache: 'npm'
        cache-dependency-path: ${{ inputs.working-directory }}/package-lock.json
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
      shell: bash
      working-directory: ${{ inputs.working-directory }}
    
    - name: Cache node_modules
      uses: actions/cache@v3
      with:
        path: ${{ inputs.working-directory }}/node_modules
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ inputs.node-version }}-${{ hashFiles(format('{0}/package-lock.json', inputs.working-directory)) }}
}}

== Monitoring and Debugging ==

=== Workflow Logs ===

Understanding workflow execution:

'''Add debug information:'''
{{Code|yaml|
steps:
- name: Debug information
  run: |
    echo "Runner OS: ${{ runner.os }}"
    echo "GitHub event: ${{ github.event_name }}"
    echo "GitHub ref: ${{ github.ref }}"
    echo "Working directory: $(pwd)"
    echo "Environment variables:"
    env | sort
}}

'''Enable step debug logging:'''
{{Code|yaml|
steps:
- name: Enable debug logging
  run: echo "::debug::This is a debug message"

- name: Set environment variable for debugging
  run: echo "ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG=true" >> $GITHUB_ENV
}}

=== Workflow Status Badges ===

Add status badges to your README:

{{Code|markdown|
![CI](https://github.com/username/repository/workflows/CI/badge.svg)
![Deploy](https://github.com/username/repository/workflows/Deploy/badge.svg?branch=main)

<!-- With specific workflow file -->
![Tests](https://github.com/username/repository/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)
}}

=== Notifications ===

Send notifications about workflow results:

{{Code|yaml|
jobs:
  notify:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: always()  # Run regardless of previous job status
    needs: [test, build, deploy]
    steps:
    - name: Notify Slack on success
      if: ${{ needs.test.result == 'success' && needs.build.result == 'success' }}
      uses: 8398a7/action-slack@v3
      with:
        status: success
        channel: '#deployments'
        webhook_url: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }}
    
    - name: Notify Slack on failure
      if: ${{ contains(needs.*.result, 'failure') }}
      uses: 8398a7/action-slack@v3
      with:
        status: failure
        channel: '#alerts'
        webhook_url: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }}
}}

== Best Practices ==

=== Security Best Practices ===

'''Protect sensitive data:'''
{{Code|yaml|
# Use secrets for sensitive information
env:
  API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}

# Avoid logging secrets
- name: Deploy
  run: |
    # Don't do this - exposes secret in logs
    # echo "Deploying with key: $API_KEY"
    
    # Do this instead
    echo "Deploying application..."
    deploy --key "$API_KEY"
  env:
    API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}

# Pin action versions
- uses: actions/checkout@v4  # Good - specific version
# - uses: actions/checkout@main  # Avoid - unpinned version
}}

'''Least privilege principle:'''
{{Code|yaml|
# Minimal permissions
permissions:
  contents: read          # Read repository contents
  pull-requests: write    # Comment on PRs
  
# For deployment workflows
permissions:
  contents: read
  deployments: write
  id-token: write        # For OIDC authentication
}}

=== Performance Optimisation ===

'''Efficient caching:'''
{{Code|yaml|
- name: Cache dependencies
  uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: |
      ~/.npm
      ~/.cache/cypress
      node_modules
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-deps-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-deps-

- name: Cache build outputs
  uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: |
      .next/cache
      dist/
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-build-${{ github.sha }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-build-
}}

'''Parallel execution:'''
{{Code|yaml|
jobs:
  test:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        shard: [1, 2, 3, 4]  # Split tests into parallel shards
    steps:
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test -- --shard=${{ matrix.shard }}/4
}}

=== Workflow Organisation ===

'''Separate concerns:'''
{{Code|text|
.github/workflows/
├── ci.yml              # Continuous integration
├── cd.yml              # Continuous deployment
├── security.yml        # Security scanning
├── dependencies.yml    # Dependency updates
└── cleanup.yml         # Maintenance tasks
}}

'''Use descriptive names:'''
{{Code|yaml|
name: CI/CD Pipeline

jobs:
  code-quality:
    name: Code Quality Checks
    steps:
    - name: Run ESLint with auto-fix
      run: npm run lint:fix
    
    - name: Check TypeScript compilation
      run: npm run type-check
    
    - name: Verify code formatting
      run: npm run format:check
}}

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Common Issues ===

'''Workflow not triggering:'''
* Check YAML syntax with a validator
* Verify trigger conditions match your events
* Ensure workflow file is in `.github/workflows/`
* Check if paths/branches filters are too restrictive

'''Job failures:'''
{{Code|yaml|
# Add debugging steps
- name: Debug environment
  run: |
    echo "PWD: $(pwd)"
    echo "Files: $(ls -la)"
    echo "Node version: $(node --version)"
    echo "NPM version: $(npm --version)"

# Check exit codes

'''Permission errors:'''
{{Code|yaml|
# Set explicit permissions
permissions:
  contents: read
  issues: write
  pull-requests: write

# Or use specific tokens
- name: Create comment
  uses: actions/github-script@v6
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    script: |
      github.rest.issues.createComment({
        issue_number: context.issue.number,
        owner: context.repo.owner,
        repo: context.repo.repo,
        body: 'Hello from GitHub Actions!'
      });
}}

=== Debugging Strategies ===

'''Local testing with act:'''
{{Code|bash|
# Install act (GitHub Actions runner)
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nektos/act/master/install.sh | bash

# Run workflows locally
act                    # Run all workflows
act push              # Simulate push event
act -j test           # Run specific job

# Use custom runner image
act -P ubuntu-latest=node:16-buster-slim
}}

'''Step-by-step debugging:'''
{{Code|yaml|
steps:
- name: Checkout
  uses: actions/checkout@v4

- name: Debug - List files
  run: find . -type f -name "*.json" | head -10

- name: Debug - Environment
  run: |
    echo "Node: $(which node)"
    echo "NPM: $(which npm)"
    echo "PATH: $PATH"

- name: Install dependencies
  run: npm ci

- name: Debug - Installed packages
  run: npm list --depth=0
}}
